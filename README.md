# Objective
The goal of this round is to make the robot car follow the line given in the arena by controlling the motors of the robot car. The movement of the robot has to be entirely autonomous. If the car comes back to its initial position after completing one lap of the track, the objective of the PS will be achieved.
The track is randomized and changes every time husky.reset() is run.
